\section{Q2}
\label{s:Q2}
Note: This algorithm has been devised as an update to the \emph{majority algorithm} and not the \emph{weighted majority algorithm} in which case the performance can be improved.

The proposed algorithm is as follows:


\begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$, leftmargin = *]
\item Perform the majority algorithm $m$ times. In these trials, the expected loss $L_T = log_{2}K + 1$.
\item At the end of these trials, every expert has made $m$ mistakes (since a trial ends only when every expert has made a mistake). 
\item Thus, the $m+1$ trial can be considered equivalent to the setting with a perfect expert. Hence, the algorithm loss $L_T = O(log_{2}K)$
\end{itemize}
Thus, total loss is $L = (m+1)log_{2}K + m$.
